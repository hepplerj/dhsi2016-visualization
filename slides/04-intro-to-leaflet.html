<h2>Leaflet</h2>
<p>Leaflet is a popular open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps, used by a range of sites including the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>, GitHub, Flickr, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and CartoDB.</p>
<p>This package makes using Leaflet in R simple.</p>
