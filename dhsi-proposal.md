title: 'R, Interactive Graphics, and Data Visualization for the Humanities'
...

The visualization of historical and literary data has become a common practice 
in digital humanities, drawing on older traditions of visualizing in these 
disciplines. A variety of out-of-the-box tools exist for easily jumping in to 
data and information visualization, but when we use these tools we run the risk 
of research questions being wedged into a tool rather than the tool fitting the 
research. This course introduces students to humanities visualizations, using a 
programming language that let researchers prioritize their questions over the 
requirements of ready-made tools. Students will learn how to 
iteratively create plots and maps using the R statistical programming 
language, as well as how to manipulate data for their purposes. Students will 
get hands-on with spatial history, charts and plots, and network visualization 
in R. Along the way basic programming concepts will be taught and not assumed as a prerequisite. Students will become familiar with the entire 
pipeline of visualization---from data manipulation to exploratory graphics to 
online interactive visualizations.

# Proposed Schedule

## Day 1: Introduction to R

-   Morning: Introduction to R
-   Afternoon: ggplot2

Discussions will include an overview of how humanities scholars are using R (and other languages), and the selection of a visualization project for students to work.

## Day 2: Data manipulation

-   Morning: Data manipulation in R with tidyr and dplyr
-   Afternoon: Further introduction to R, including knitr/rmarkdown

Discussions will include best practices for data formats. Students will gather and manipulate the data for their projects.

## Day 3: Spatial History and Mapping

-   Morning: Mapping with Leaflet
-   Afternoon: Basic Shiny web apps

Discussions will include an overview of how humanities scholars are creating online visualizations. Students will begin the online portion of their visualization.

## Day 4: Networks

-   Morning: Introduction to Network Analysis in R
-   Afternoon: Introduction to Interactive Networks

Discussions will include best practices in network visualizations. Students will have the opportunity to implement and experiment with networks with either their own data or with sample data provided.

## Day 5: Student Projects

-   Morning: Intermediate Shiny
-   Afternoon: Presentation and discussion of projects
