title: 'R, D3.js, and Data Visualization for the Humanities'
...

A variety of out-of-the-box tools exist for easily jumping in to data
and information visualization, but when we use these tools we run the
risk of research questions being wedged into a tool rather than the tool
fitting the research. The visualization of larger amounts of historical
and literary data has become a common practice in digital humanities,
drawing on older traditions of visualizing in these disciplines. This
course introduces students to humanities visualizations, using
programming languages that let researchers prioritize their questions
over the requirements of ready-made tools.\* Students will learn how to
rapidly and iteratively create basic plots and maps using the R
statistical programming language, as well as how to manipulate data for
their purposes. The second half of the course will introduce the basics
of D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for visualizing data
interactively on the web. Students will get hands-on with spatial
history, charts and plots, and network visualization in D3. The course
will begin to answer Johanna Drucker's call for tools built by and for
the humanities and work towards what Elijah Meeks calls interactive
scholarly works, as students are introduced to the entire pipeline of
visualization from data manipulation, to exploratory graphics to online
visualization,

\* *Basic programming concepts are taught but not assumed as a
prerequisite.*

# Proposed Schedule

## Day 1: Introduction to R

-   Morning: Introduction to R; basic plots
-   Afternoon: Basic maps in R/ggplot2

Discussions will include an overview of how humanities scholars are
using R, and the selection of a visualization project for students to
work.

## Day 2: Data manipulation

-   Morning: Data manipulation in R with tidyr and dplyr
-   Afternoon: Basic programming techniques in R

Discussions will include best practices for data formats. Students will
gather and manipulate the data for their projects.

## Day 3: Introduction to D3.js

-   Morning: Introduction to programming in JavaScript and DOM
    manipulation
-   Afternoon: Introduction to D3.js concepts

Discussions will include an overview of how humanities scholars are
creating online visualizations. Students will begin the online portion
of their visualization.

## Day 4: Plotting and interactivity in D3.js

-   Morning: Continuation of basic plots and maps in D3.js
-   Afternoon: Interactivity in D3.js

Discussions will include best practices for interactivity. Students will
continue to work on their visualizations.

## Day 5: Student Projects

-   Morning: D3.js techniques relevant to student projects
-   Afternoon: Presentation and discussion of projects
