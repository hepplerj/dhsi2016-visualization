## Aim of this worksheet

This worksheet will walk you through the basics of using the Leaflet package in R. Once you've finished the worksheet, you should have a good familiarity with how the package works 
Let's start with our setup. You should already have the dependencies necessary to run Leaflet and some of the other functions in this worksheet, so we'll load up the packages we need.

```{r, eval=F}
library(leaflet)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(magrittr)
```
